# Instructions for Creating a New Feature

When implementing a complete feature follow these steps:

- Use types defined in `src/shared/type.<type-name>.ts` for all data structures.
- Use modals, events, and existing components as needed to implement the feature.
- Use existing CSS variables for all styling as defined in `static/app.css`
