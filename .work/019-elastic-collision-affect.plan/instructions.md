Create an "elastic collision" affect. Any objects with this affect will bounce off of each other if they collide. Blockade circles should bounce, not end of game. The blockades should be gray. There should be another circle type called "voids" that end the game if the player touches them. Blockades, hero circles, and hunters should have the elastic collision affect so that they bounce off of each other. There should be a new circle type available in all the game modes called "ghosts" that act like the hunters but do not have the elastic collision affect.
