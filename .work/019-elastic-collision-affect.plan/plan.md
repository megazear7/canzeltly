# Step 1
Create an "elastic collision" affect.
Any objects with this affect will bounce off of each other if they collide.

# Step 2
Blockade circles should NOT end of game when the hero collides with them.
The blockades should be gray.
Blockades, hero circles, and hunters should have the elastic collision affect so that they bounce off of each other.

# Step 3
There should be another circle type called "voids" that end the game if the player touches them.
Voids should be black.
Voids should be available in all of the game modes.

# Step 4
There should be a new circle type available in all the game modes called "ghosts" that act like the hunters but do NOT have the elastic collision affect.
Collisions with ghosts end the game and target the player like hunters do
Ghosts should be available in all the game modes.
