A game should only appear in the saved games list if the user saved it, it should not appear by default after using the create game page. We will need to somehow transfer the state from the create game page to the play component in a different local storage property and add a get param to the play game page that tells it to not look for the game id in the normal local storage place but to instead look in some other local storage property. We could call this other property "created-game" or something.
