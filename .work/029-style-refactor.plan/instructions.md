Review the entire code base. Common styles such as buttons should be moved into `src/client/styles.component.ts` and improted where needed. Default element styling should be put in `src/client/styles.global.ts`. Pixel sizes, colors, box shadows, borders, etc. should all go in css variables in src/static/app.css. Create a new .work plan for your proposed changes, identifying bad practices that are in the code base. Also update the prompts, skills, and instructions under `.github/` as needed to keep the documentation accurate and up to date. Once your work is complete, I will review and modify the notes you took and then ask you to implement the changes once I approve.
