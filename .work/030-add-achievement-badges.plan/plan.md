# Achievement Badges Plan

## Overview
Add a badge system to reward players for various achievements in the game. Badges should be earned for milestones like defeating campaigns, playing games, surviving in survival mode, collecting objects, and collecting badges themselves. Include a progress bar on the home page showing completion percentage.

## Key Features
- Badge definitions with criteria (e.g., play 10 games, survive 1 minute in survival)
- Tracking of player achievements and badge unlocks
- UI to display earned badges
- Progress bar showing total badges collected vs. total available
- Persistence of badge data

## Badge Categories
1. Campaign victories
2. Game play counts (10, 100, 1000 games)
3. Survival time milestones (1, 10, 100, 1000 minutes)
4. Object collection (10, 100, 1000 green circles)
5. Badge collection milestones (10, 100, 1000 badges)

## Implementation Areas
- Data models for badges and achievements
- Game logic to track and award badges
- UI components for badge display and progress
- Storage integration for persistence
- Integration with existing game modes and campaigns
